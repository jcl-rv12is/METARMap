## Detailed instructions

See the Word document Metar Map Software Install and Config - 20231024.docx for complete hardware/software installation instructions.  Embedded in the document is an alternate displaymetar.py script, which will put much larger text on the optional OLED display, albeit with less information - airport code, flight category, wind speed and direction.
